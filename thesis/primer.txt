Sometimes short term solutions ultimately make the conditions they are trying to alleviate worse in the long run. Some AI planning algorithms either favor short term solutions or favor long term solutions and fail to utilize short-term boot-strapping techniques. Stacked de-noising autoencoders show promise of discovering the deep hierarchical structure in data in machine perception tasks, and can be applied to planning straightforwardly. I propose to test existing planning algorithms against a stacked de-noising autoencoder based algorithm to test the hypothesis that it will achieve a better balance between long term and short term solutions.
